# Big-Data-Case

This is a descrisptive data analysis on AHA databse which contains observations for twelve variables on over 2000 hospitals in the United States of America. I used R programming to find the relationship between the variables and made conclusions on them. The project contains descriptive statistics about the hospitals and has useful information that can assist business decision makers to understand the hospitals and make more information-based decisons.
